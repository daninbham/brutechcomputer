When we are not remodeling the house, we are attempting to chisel away at our golf handicaps, so far with modest success.</p><p>I have worked on nearly everything in personal technology; computer hardware and software; programming; home networks; phone equipment; mobile; security systems; and home automation.</p><p>I began my interests in computers and technology at the age of 15.  I started my first business while still in college pursuing a computer science degree.  After selling that business seven years later, I was hired as the lead Information Technology Technician at Western Washington University.  After 16 years, I moved on as the Information Technology Manager for a large Heavy Industrial Construction company.</p><p>Now wanting to be closer to family, and better weather, I have once again started my own business.</p><p>My goal is to use my 35 years of computer experience to assist my clients in all their technology needs.  I hope to help you enjoy technology as much as I do, or at least make yours work better.
