          I live in Pecan Plantation with my wife, Yvonne, and two small dogs.  When we are not remodeling the house, we are attempting to chisel away at our golf handicaps, so far with modest success.
        p. 
          I have worked on nearly everything in personal technology; computer hardware and software; programming; home networks; phone equipment; mobile; security systems; and home automation.
        p.
          I began my interests in computers and technology at the age of 15.  I started my first business while still in college pursuing a computer science degree.  After selling that business seven years later, I was hired as the lead Information Technology Technician at Western Washington University.  After 16 years, I moved on as the Information Technology Manager for a large Heavy Industrial Construction company.
        p.
          Now wanting to be closer to family, and better weather, I have once again started my own business.
        p.
          My goal is to use my 35 years of computer experience to assist my clients in all their technology needs.  I hope to help you enjoy technology as much as I do, or at least make yours work better.
